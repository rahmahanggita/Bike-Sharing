# Bike Sharing System

This project involves analyzing a bike-sharing dataset to extract insights and make data-driven decisions. The Jupyter Notebook provided in this repository guides users through the process of loading, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing the data.

## Project Overview

One of the biggest challenges for bike-sharing service providers is ensuring a profitable and sustainable business model while delivering a positive experience for both casual and registered users. In an effort to optimize operations and enhance user experience, bike-sharing service providers face the challenge of accurately predicting bike demand. Factors such as weather changes, seasons, time of day, and day of the week can influence the number of bike rentals.

To address this challenge, a machine learning (ML) model is needed to predict bike demand based on historical data and these external variables. An accurate prediction model allows companies to allocate bikes more efficiently, plan maintenance and distribution, and set appropriate pricing strategies, ultimately improving user satisfaction and operational efficiency.

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, correcting data types, and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing the data to identify patterns and trends.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features that can enhance the predictive power of the data.
- **Modeling:** Applying machine learning models to predict bike usage based on various factors.
- **Visualization:** Creating insightful visualizations to communicate findings.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you will need the following libraries installed:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `jupyter`

You can install the required libraries using:
